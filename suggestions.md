# Mission

This is not a place for organizing, that should be done away from here and more intimately, to avoid infiltration. This is a place for socialization, for uniting and debating, for getting to the bottom of problems and discussions. If we don't think that communism is a scientifically viable option for the continued process of production, then we are not actually convinced and fighting for communism. The urge has to be aligned with a materialistic analysis of our collective and individual historical process of production.

We need to incentivize modes of interacting that promotes the end goals of the site and these must be robust. Therefore, we must allow for the publication of things that can be read by anyone, we must promote anonymity to evade doxxing and we must be open to criticism from any valid critique on any aspect of our analyses. That way we strengthen the advancement of leftist unity, scientific discourse and  socialization.

## Security

The way we structure the site and the purposes for the existence must coincide with three things: 1. keeping members safe; 2. keeping members informed and; 3. maintaining the ideal of achieving communism while it shows to be the best systemic option. Maintaining these things will allow the site to be robust against reactionary attacks.

## Suggestions for use of Leftbook

- Promote the scientific progression of leftist discourse through discussion or sharing material
    - robust: There is no need to out ones self to openly talk about a topic through the lens of science. The scientific method will allow for rules that limit discourse and place similar expectations on every member in relation to rhetoric. This maintains the ideal of achieving communism while it shows to be the best systemic option.
- Promote leftist unity through an open anonymous and healthy location for socializing
    - robust: We can share memes, talk about regional problems and interact without giving too much personal information. Joking around and sharing memes helps keep members informed. Conversations help maintain the ideal of achieving communism while it shows to be the best systemic option.
- Promote leftist organizations, unions and projects
    - robust: Promoting existing spaces, organizations and projects helps expand things that need promotion in the leftist sphere and can be done without doxxing ones self. Doing such things helps out these projects which in turn helps  maintain the ideal of achieving communism while it shows to be the best systemic option.
- Promote events and protests
    - robust: Promoting existing events and protests helps expand things that need promotion in the leftist sphere and can be done without doxxing ones self. Doing such things helps out these mobilizations which in turn helps maintain the ideal of achieving communism while it shows to be the best systemic option.

## Suggestions of what should be avoided on Leftbook

- Organizing groups, real world events or protests
    - not robust: Any kind of organization through here is done while interacting with people one has never seen before. This creates too much centralization on this site for things that are best done locally, personally and with tight knit groups. Interacting with strangers online may sometimes lead to good results, but the risk is high. This kind of interaction may lead to creating small circles of misinformation and could help destroy the ideal of achieving communism while it shows to be the best systemic option.
